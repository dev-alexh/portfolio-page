# portfolio-page
Portfolio page web project created for the Responsive Web Design Certificate (freeCodeCamp).

Languages: HTML5, CSS3

Goal: To learn how to utilize HTML5 and CSS3 to create responsive webpages. Future projects will introduce frameworks and libraries. This page will be my personal portfolio page for the time being (in the future this will be improved using the Bootstrap framework).
